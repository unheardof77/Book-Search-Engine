# Book Search Refractor [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This application is a refractor of a restful API.  I was tasked with taking an existing functional website and converting it to use GraphQL.  This involved refracturing many lines of existing code.  I did this in order to test my knowledge of GraphQL and further my understanding of it.  This application is functionally the same yet structurally different than before.
